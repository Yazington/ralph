# Tech Stack (Do Not Modify)
{tech_stack}

# Persistent Context (Update Files as Needed)

Requirements: Read from ../research/requirements.md
Tests: Run from ../research/tests/
SDK: Use from ../research/sdk/ if available

Current Files:

- none at the moment

To-Do (Highest Priority First):

- [ ] Read requirements/tests from ../research/.
- [ ] Generate/update code to satisfy requirements.
- [ ] If issues (e.g., 3rd-party), search internet via code (e.g., requests.get docs/sites).
- [ ]. Run tests - fix failures.
- [ ] Lint all code with pylint, flake8, black - fix issues.

Git: Commit after each step with "Impl: [step]".

<instruction>
You are restricted to the ./impl/ folder - read from ../research/ but do not modify it. Review context. Implement the highest priority To-Do item. Handle 3rd-party issues with internet searches (write/exec code to fetch info). Ensure all tests pass. If requirements fully satisfied and tests green, output <done>COMPLETE</done>.
