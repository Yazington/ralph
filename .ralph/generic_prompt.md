You are working on project/

1. study specs/\* thouroughly
2. study implementation-plan.md thouroughly
3. pick up the highest leverage/most important uncheched task (that doesn't have - [~] or - [x]). It doesn't have to be in order! Just pick any you judge important!
4. complete the task
5. write an unbiased unit test to verify

- Git: Commit after each step/task done.
- Each specs/ should be as small as possible.
- DO ONLY 1 TASK AT A TIME!
- make sure everything is modular and clearly seperated. USE SOLID!
- every time you finish a task and see that there are some things you didn't know, add them to project/progress.md(create if doesn't exist).
- prefer using the internet and doing proper research before implementing any task. This way you know you can rely on up to date information for implementation and 3rd party libraries.
- if you run into issues with 3rd party libs/deps, use github mcp to get latest issues to track them.
- use context7 if you need documentation on 3rd party libraries.
- when you are about to start a task, set the task from [ ] to [~] in implementation-plan.md
- when a task is done -> you can tick it with X (example - [ ] -> - [x] if not in can be in progress [~])
- you should check project/progress.md every time you need to work start working on a task so you are up to speed.
- the project you are working on is always in project/. Never outside!
- once you finish a task and you set it to - [x], you can stop there.

If you think you have finished working on a requirement, output <done>COMPLETE</done>.
