      "selftext": "After a long time with Todoist, I spent the last couple of months searching for alternative systems. But once again, I came back to Todoist, though I have some serious pain points that don't seem that hard to adress?\n\n**Projects vs. Areas**\n\nEverything in Todoist is a \"project.\" But here's the issue: my health isn't a project, it's an area of my life. Same with work, home, etc. Sure, we can work around this by using these as parent folders and placing actual projects underneath them. But this creates visual clutter. And speaking of which, how is it taking 8+ months to fix the # symbol and color issues? That's just ridiculous.\n\n**No Way to Close/Complete Projects**\n\nSince everything is treated as a project, let's say I have a project for renovating my home. When it's done... why can't I actually *close* or *finish* the project? Yes, you can archive it, but that feels like a workaround, not a proper solution.\n\nThings 3 handles this beautifully with dedicated Areas and the ability to properly close projects. I really miss that already. \n\n**Kanban Board** frustration\n\nThe Kanban board feature is great, I actually prefer it for complex projects to track task statuses visually or work with someone. However, there's a frustrating thing.. When you complete a task from the Today view, it stays stuck in whatever column it was in on the board.\n\nFor example, say I have columns for Backlog → Doing → Review → Done. A task is in Review with a deadline today. I complete it from my Today view, and it gets checked off—but it remains stuck in the Review column. To actually move it to Done, I have to go into the project, uncheck the task, manually drag it to the Done column, and then check it off again. What? \n\nSubtasks could be such a powerful feature, but right now they're practically useless.\n\nLet's say I have a task with 2 subtasks, all due today. First problem: I can only set the due date on the parent task, because if I set dates on the subtasks individually, they show up in Today view without any context, just floating subtasks with no indication of what larger task they belong to.\n\nSecond problem: To actually see what subtasks are part of a task, I have to click into it and expand them manually. Why isn't there an option to show subtasks inline in the Today view? The worst part? This option *does* exist when you are looking where the task itself lives.... So Todoist clearly knows how to display subtasks inline, they just won't let us do it in Today view where it actually matters.\n\nThere's a reason I keep coming back to Todoist, and it's because at its core, it's an amazing app. The interesting features they're adding (like Ramble and the recent calendar integrations), the incredibly powerful repeating task options, and the natural language processing are all top-notch.\n\nRant over haha.   \nIt's by far the best todo app that can handle more complex workflows without needing to go all in on Notion or other heavy project management tools. That's why, despite my frustrations, I always end up back here. \n\n",

      "selftext": "You open your laptop to capture a spark from a client call-and the cursor blinks. Do you drop it into a clean markdown note you can back up forever, or a living database that can sort, filter, and ship team updates at speed? In 2025, **Notion AI** and **Obsidian** represent two very different bets on your second brain: one is database-first with AI baked into daily workflows; the other is local-first, markdown-pure, endlessly extensible with plugins. If you care about **Zettelkasten**, reliable **exports**, and avoiding lock-in while keeping your daily notes fast, this guide is for you.\n\n# Core Philosophy &amp; Use Cases: Database-first vs Local-first Notes\n\n**What’s the fundamental difference between Notion’s blocks/databases and Obsidian’s markdown files?**\n\n**Notion’s model: blocks + databases.** Every piece of content-text, to-do, image, embed-is a **block** you can transform, nest, and rearrange. Blocks live inside pages, and pages can be turned into **databases** with properties (tags, dates, relations, rollups) plus multiple views (table, board, list, calendar, timeline). That makes Notion exceptional for structured workflows like roadmaps, content calendars, and CRM-style trackers.[ Notion+3Notion+3Notion+3](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/types-of-content-blocks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Obsidian’s model: markdown files in a vault.** Obsidian stores notes as plain **.md** files in a local **vault** (a normal folder), which means your content is portable, editable with any text editor, and available offline by default. Links, backlinks, and graph views layer on top, while community plugins (e.g., **Dataview** and **Database Folder**) simulate Notion-like queries and dashboards-without giving up file ownership.[ RafaelGB+4Obsidian Help+4Obsidian Help+4](https://help.obsidian.md/data-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Mental model shift:**\n\n* Choose **Notion** when your notes must behave like **data**\\-filterable, grouped, and joined across projects and teams.  \n* Choose **Obsidian** when you want **files first**\\-fast capture, durable archives, and plugins that evolve your system without moving your notes off disk.  \n\n**Who should choose Notion AI vs Obsidian for personal knowledge management (PKM) in 2025?**\n\n**Snapshot match (with sources):**\n\n|Scenario / Need|Best Fit|Why (one-liner)|Key Source|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Team wikis, roadmaps, and shared trackers|**Notion AI**|Databases + multi-view layouts, rich properties, and AI Q&amp;A/search across workspace|([Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/using-database-views?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|\n|Solo researcher building a durable Zettelkasten|**Obsidian**|Local markdown, instant offline, powerful backlinks/graph, plugin freedom|([Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/data-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|\n|SQL-ish queries over notes (tasks, tags, frontmatter)|**Obsidian (Dataview)**|Treat your vault like a database; write queries/tables/lists|([Blacksmith GUI](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|\n|Notion-style dashboards inside markdown|**Obsidian (Database Folder + Dataview)**|WYSIWYG table views over notes with editable fields|([RafaelGB](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|\n|AI summaries, rewrite, and meeting notes inside the editor|**Notion AI**|Native AI blocks, Ask AI, Q&amp;A over workspace content|([Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|\n|Cross-platform, privacy-sensitive, no internet required|**Obsidian**|Notes are files on device; full mobile + desktop|([Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/data-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|\n\nTip: If you’re tempted to replicate Notion databases in Obsidian, start with **Dataview** for read-only tables and add **Database Folder** when you need inline editing. This keeps your content in markdown while gaining structure.[ Blacksmith GUI+1](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Pricing, offline access, and platform support-how do they impact daily note-taking?**\n\n**Pricing (as of October 2025):**\n\n* **Notion** offers Free, Plus, Business, Enterprise-with a separate **Notion AI** add-on historically, and **2025 pricing updates** rolling out mid-year for some plans; always verify which tiers include AI/Q&amp;A in your region and account type.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Obsidian** core app is free for personal use; paid add-ons include **Sync** (E2EE) and **Publish**, plus optional **Commercial** license for organizations.

My current stack: capture and think in **Obsidian**; publish and coordinate in **Notion**. When deadlines spike, the local-first speed and predictable file structure keep me calm; when the team needs status at 9:00 AM, database views do the talking.\n\n**A powerful lens from a famous book**\n\n**Deep Work** by Cal Newport argues for the **Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection**\\-pick tools whose **net positive impact** on your most important outcomes clearly outweighs the costs. Don’t adopt a tool for any small benefit; adopt it because it decisively advances the work that matters. (See *Deep Work*, **Rule #3: Quit Social Media**, and discussion around the craftsman approach; related summaries place the core idea early, with the “deep work hypothesis” noted around **p. 14**.)[ getclockwise.com+1](https://www.getclockwise.com/blog/deep-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# Fast Capture &amp; Daily Notes Workflows\n\n**Quick capture on mobile/desktop-what’s the fastest “inbox” flow in each app?**\n\n**Notion AI (fast capture ideas):**\n\n* **Mobile widgets to one-tap into a page**\\-pin your “Inbox” or “Daily Notes” page to iOS/Android home for immediate capture. Set a default database template so every new line becomes a task or note with tags pre-filled.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/mobile-widgets?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Slash to structure as you type**\\-drop /todo, /callout, or /web to turn raw text into trackable blocks in seconds. If your inbox is a database, each new row inherits properties you define.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/using-slash-commands?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Keyboard acceleration**\\-on desktop, memorize the core hotkeys for new page, inline to-do, and turning text into blocks so your hands never leave the keyboard. Notion’s official keyboard list is worth a skim and a sticky note.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Obsidian (fast capture ideas):**\n\n* **Daily Notes core plugin**\\-one hotkey opens today’s note; set your cursor to the “inbox” section at top. This is the quickest zero-friction capture anchor for journaling, standups, and scratchpad ideas.[ Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/daily-notes?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **QuickAdd for instant append**\\-create macros to append a timestamped bullet to “📥 Inbox.md” from anywhere, even with a modal that asks for title/tags. It’s the community favorite for speed-capture.[ QuickAdd](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Templates core plugin**\\-stamp a header with {{date}} and {{time}}, plus frontmatter like tags: and source: so ideas land structured without thinking.[ Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/templates?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**When speed wins:** If you rely on phone-first capture during commutes, Notion’s **home-screen widget → Inbox page** is highly reliable. If you live in a terminal/editor flow, Obsidian’s **Daily Notes hotkey + QuickAdd** is lightning-fast and fully offline.[ Notion+2Obsidian Help+2](https://www.notion.com/help/mobile-widgets?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Templates, slash commands, and hotkeys-how to make daily notes effortless**\n\n**Notion AI workflow:**\n\n* Build a **Daily Note template** with sections like “Top 3,” “Quick Log,” and “Meetings,” then spawn it each morning with a keystroke. The / menu converts text into blocks on the fly-tables for quick totals, callouts for decisions, and toggles for collapsible outlines. Pair with built-in **reminders** for temporal nudges.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/using-slash-commands?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* If your daily notes live inside a **database**, pre-attach properties like “Project,” “Status,” or “Effort,” then switch views (board, table, calendar) to review the week at a glance.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/category/documentation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Keep the **keyboard shortcuts** doc open in a side tab for a week and deliberately practice 3–5 shortcuts a day. Compound gains arrive quickly once creating, moving, and transforming blocks is muscle memory.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Obsidian workflow:**\n\n* Use **Templates** for repeatable sections and timestamp tokens; it removes the micro-decisions that slow you down. If you outgrow core Templates, move to **Templater** for JS-powered automation and dynamic fields.[ Obsidian Help+1](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/templates?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Combine **Daily Notes + QuickAdd** to spin up new “Daily” pages with one shortcut and auto-insert a template. QuickAdd can also create “Meeting Note” files from a form, so every capture looks consistent.[ Obsidian Help+1](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/daily-notes?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Keep the **Command palette** visible in your habits; tie your most-used commands to custom hotkeys and you’ll feel the editor disappear.[ Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Practitioner tip:** Notion’s slash is unbeatable for **on-the-fly structure**, while Obsidian’s templates and hotkeys shine for **editor-native speed**. If you want the best of both, design the same headings and fields in both apps so your brain reuses one pattern everywhere.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/using-slash-commands?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Meeting notes and tasks-best practices to link notes with action items**\n\n**In Notion AI:**\n\n* Capture meetings in a **Meetings database** with a template that includes Agenda, Decisions, and Action Items. Use inline **to-dos** and convert them to rows in a **Tasks database** via relations/rollups, or track them directly in the same meeting page. Built-in **reminders** push follow-ups to your sidebar and notifications.[ Notion+2Notion+2](https://www.notion.com/templates/meeting-notes-action-items?srsltid=AfmBOoozXf0vlK8LX5nm3H8WjvfUG3zHsrMinkqMpc2q1RB6RyPHSTOY&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* For recurring standups, spin up a **calendar view** of meeting notes so you can scroll history by date and filter by “Owner” or “Project.”[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/category/documentation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**In Obsidian:**\n\n* Use the **Tasks plugin** to add due dates, recurrence, and queries that list open items on your daily note automatically. Each checkbox becomes queryable across the vault.[ Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/introduction?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* If you prefer one-note-per-meeting, pair Tasks with **TaskNotes** or a simple template so action items sit under a consistent “Next Actions” heading and get hoovered into dashboards via queries.[ callumalpass.github.io](https://callumalpass.github.io/tasknotes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Quality bar for meeting docs:** All action items should include an owner, outcome, and date. In Notion, that’s properties; in Obsidian, that’s frontmatter or inline syntax (due:: 2025-10-21, owner:: akash) so your query tools can find them later.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/help/sprints?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Personal experience (why this section matters)**\n\nMy biggest unlock was separating **capture** from **processing**. I capture ruthlessly in Obsidian with a QuickAdd “Flash” macro that appends a timestamped bullet to Inbox from a global hotkey, no questions asked. Twice a day, I triage those bullets: if it’s project work or shared context, I push it into a Notion database so the team can see it and attach reminders; if it’s research or writing seeds, it stays in Obsidian to evolve. That split stopped the chaos of half-baked tasks buried in personal notes and made reviews dependable.\n\n**A powerful lens from a famous book**\n\nJames Clear’s **Atomic Habits** frames friction as destiny-**the Third Law: Make it easy**. If your capture step requires too many taps or too much thought, you won’t do it when life is messy. Reduce steps, make the default obvious, and your notes will actually happen. For a concise articulation of the four laws, see the author’s official summary; “Make it easy” is the third law. (Atomic Habits, Four Laws overview)[ jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# Zettelkasten, Backlinks &amp; Evergreen Notes\n\n**How to set up a Zettelkasten in Notion AI vs Obsidian (atomic notes, structure, and note IDs)**\n\n**Zettelkasten in Obsidian (local-first, markdown-native):**\n\n1. **Create a vault** named zettel. Each idea lives in its own .md file-short, self-contained, written in your own words. Many practitioners call these “permanent notes” that grow over time.[ Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/new-user-zettlekasten-ish-simple-setup/84679?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n2. **Adopt durable IDs.** A simple YYYYMMDDHHmm prefix (e.g., 202510201205 urban-heat-islands.md) keeps files unique and sortable without special software. This mirrors long-standing slip-box practice and plays well with search and Git.  \n3. **Link as you write.** Use \\[\\[wikilinks\\]\\] for every connection that feels useful; don’t overthink taxonomy on day one. Obsidian’s **Backlinks** core plugin collects all incoming links to the note you’re in, and the **Graph view** gives a bird’s-eye map of how ideas cluster.[ Obsidian Help+1](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/backlinks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n4. **Fleeting → Literature → Permanent.** Keep a lightweight path: fleeting notes (raw capture) roll into literature notes (source-bound highlights), which distill into permanent notes (one idea per note). This three-step rhythm is a reliable on-ramp for beginners and scales to a lifetime archive.[ Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/new-user-zettlekasten-ish-simple-setup/84679?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n5. **Daily processing loop.** Open your Daily Note, scan yesterday’s captures, promote 1–3 into permanent notes, and create links both ways. Over weeks, you’ll notice topic “constellations” emerging in Graph view.[ Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/graph?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nZettelkasten in Notion AI (database-first with backlinks):\n\n1. **One page per idea** still works-Notion can absolutely do atomic notes. Create a “Notes” database; each row is a page titled with the idea.  \n2. **Use properties** like Topic (multi-select), Source (URL), and Status (seed/draft/evergreen).  \n3. **Link pages** using \\[\\[ (or @) to mention another page; Notion automatically creates **backlinks** at the top of the target page so you can navigate your web of ideas.[ Notion+2Notion+2](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/creating-links-and-backlinks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n4. **Surface structure with views.** A board view grouped by Status, a table sorted by Topic, and a calendar for “revisit” dates create quick review rituals-plus AI can summarize or expand a note during revision.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n5. **Note IDs in Notion.** You can mimic Zettelkasten IDs by prefixing the page title (20251020 urban heat islands) or storing an ID property. It’s optional, but helpful if you plan migrations or want chronological queries.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Obsidian gives you Zettelkasten with **zero impedance**\\-IDs in filenames, links in plain text, visual clusters in Graph view. Notion gives you **structured Zettelkasten**\\-atomic pages inside a database, queryable with properties and navigable via built-in backlinks.[ Obsidian Help+1](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/graph?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Backlinks, graph views, and contextual links-what’s native, what needs plugins?**\n\n**Obsidian (native + extensible):**\n\n* **Backlinks:** Core plugin-shows every note that links to the active note; pin it in the right sidebar for constant context.[ Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/backlinks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Graph view:** Core plugin-interactive map of your vault; filter by tags, folders, and link types to reveal clusters or isolate a project.[ Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/graph?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Contextual navigation:** Hover previews and the local graph make it easy to trace one topic’s neighborhood without opening 20 tabs. Community threads also cover graph/backlink display nuances if you want more than the defaults.[ Obsidian Forum+1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-see-backlinks-in-graph-view/54613?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Notion (native backlinks, different visualization):**\n\n* **Backlinks:** Built-in-any time you link or @-mention a page, Notion adds a backlinks panel at the top of the referenced page. This is great for surfacing “where else this idea appears” across wikis and project docs.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/help/create-links-and-backlinks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Graph-style visualization:** Notion focuses on databases and multi-view dashboards; a native global “node graph” isn’t part of its current core. You’ll rely on page mentions, linked databases, and dashboard charts rather than a link graph.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/charts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Where plugins matter:** In Obsidian, you can extend context with plugins that show siblings, visualize link directions, or compute relatedness; Notion’s equivalent power is in database relations/rollups and filters that approximate “context neighborhoods” without a graph.\n\n**Tags vs folders vs databases-organizing ideas for long-term retrieval**\n\n**Obsidian’s trio (folders, tags, links):**\n\n* **Folders** are for broad, stable buckets you’d happily see in your file system forever (/people, /concepts, /projects).  \n* **Tags** are lightweight labels for cross-cutting concerns (#status/evergreen, #method/zettel, #reading).  \n* **Links** are the connective tissue that turns notes into a network.  Community explainers emphasize that tags and links aren’t enemies-use both, and let links do the semantic heavy lifting while tags enable quick filtering and graph overlays.[ Obsidian Forum+2Obsidian Forum+2](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/folders-vs-linking-vs-tags-the-definitive-guide-extremely-short-read-this/78468?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Notion’s approach (databases + properties):**\n\n* Replace “tags” with a **multi-select property**; replace “folders” with separate **databases** or filterable views within one database.  \n* Use **relations** to connect ideas (note ↔ source, note ↔ project) and **rollups** to bubble up counts or summaries. Notion’s backlinks help you navigate between related pages even when they live in different databases.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/create-links-and-backlinks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**A simple, durable pattern:**\n\n* Keep **few folders** in Obsidian; prefer linking for relationships and use tags sparingly for status.  \n* In Notion, keep **one Notes database** with clear properties; link out to Sources and Projects databases so queries stay fast and views stay simple.  \n\n**Personal experience (why this section matters)**\n\nMy Zettelkasten finally clicked when I stopped hoarding highlights and started writing **one-paragraph ideas** in my own words. In Obsidian, that meant a timestamped filename, two sentences of synthesis, and at least two \\[\\[links\\]\\]-no exceptions. In Notion, it meant a Notes database with a Status property set to “seed” or “evergreen,” plus page mentions to related ideas. After a month, Obsidian’s Graph view revealed a tight cluster around “prompt evaluation,” which led me to ship a better rubric; in Notion, backlinks on a single idea page showed every meeting where that concept came up, which helped me craft a client update in minutes.\n\n**A powerful lens from a famous book**\n\nSönke Ahrens, **How to Take Smart Notes**\\-the chapter on **Permanent Notes** argues that knowledge compounds when you write ideas in your own words, link them to existing notes, and revisit them during regular processing sessions. See the discussion of permanent notes and the slip-box workflow (often referenced in print editions around the early middle chapters). Pair this with your tool of choice: Obsidian’s local files and backlinks, or Notion’s page mentions and database relations, both honor the principle of small, connected ideas that grow into publishable work.\n\n# Plugins, AI, and Automation (Obsidian Plugins vs Notion AI Features)\n\n**Which Obsidian plugin categories replicate Notion’s databases, queries, and dashboards?**\n\n**Queries over markdown (Notion-style “treat notes like data”):**\n\n* **Dataview** turns your vault into a queryable dataset. It reads frontmatter and inline fields, then renders tables, lists, and calendars based on filters/sorts-very close to running structured queries on a Notion database. It also exposes a **JavaScript API** for custom views.[ Blacksmith GUI+2GitHub+2](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Editable tables/dashboards inside Obsidian:**\n\n* **Database Folder** builds full, Notion-like database views **from folders, tags, links, or Dataview queries**. You can **edit fields inline** in the table and write them back to the underlying markdown-so your “database” stays plain text.[ RafaelGB+1](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* There are other options in the same space (e.g., an older “obsidian-database-plugin”), but Database Folder + Dataview is the widely recommended combo in 2025.[ GitHub+1](https://github.com/tomaszkiewicz/obsidian-database-plugin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Tasks as queryable data:**\n\n* **Tasks** adds due dates, recurrence, status, and **vault-wide queries** for checkboxes-ideal for making “My Week” dashboards without leaving markdown.[ Obsidian+2GitHub+2](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Capture + templating (the glue for dashboards):**\n\n* **QuickAdd** gives single-keystroke capture into the right file or database-like table (via templates/macros).  \n* **Templater** enables programmable templates (JS), dynamic fields, and automation from inside notes-handy for consistently structured “rows.”[ Silent Void 13+3GitHub+3Obsidian Forum+3](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Bottom line:** In Obsidian, you can approximate much of Notion’s database power by chaining **Dataview (queries) + Database Folder (editable tables) + Tasks (actions) + Templater/QuickAdd (structure &amp; speed)**\\-all while keeping everything in **portable markdown**.[ RafaelGB+1](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Using AI in both tools-summaries, rewrite, Q&amp;A over your notes, and guardrails**\n\n**Notion AI (native):**\n\n* **Q&amp;A over your workspace** searches across pages and databases to answer questions inside Notion. It can summarize docs, draft content, and help you “chat with” your workspace. Notion documents how Q&amp;A surfaces answers from your data and describes the AI assistant’s broader capabilities.[ Notion+2Notion+2](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/category/ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Privacy/guardrails:** Notion states that AI subprocessors **can’t use your content to train their models** and outlines security practices on its product page. Review your plan to confirm what’s included.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/product/ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Obsidian (plugin-based):**\n\n* You can bring AI into Obsidian through community plugins and scripts-e.g., **Templater** plus **AI extensions** to call LLMs during note creation, or third-party AI helpers. This keeps AI optional and under your local-first workflow.[ Silent Void 13+1](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Practical guidance:**\n\n* If you want **chat/Q&amp;A over a team knowledge base**, Notion’s native AI is turnkey.  \n* If you prefer **local-first control**, Obsidian keeps your notes in files and lets you selectively invoke AI via plugins or external tools.  \n\n**Automation &amp; integrations-when to use plugins, Notion databases, and third-party bridges**\n\n**Notion’s automation stack (choose when your workflows live in databases):**\n\n* **Relations &amp; Rollups** connect databases (e.g., Tasks ↔ Projects) and bubble up counters, dates, or summaries-critical for automated project dashboards.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Database Automations** trigger actions when properties change-assign owners, move statuses, and more. This reduces manual upkeep for teams.[ Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/database-automations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **API + Zapier/Integrations:** Use the **Notion API** to programmatically create/query pages and databases or connect 8,000+ apps with **Zapier** for event-driven syncs. Ideal for CRM updates, pipeline handoffs, and cross-app notifications.[ Zapier+3Notion Developers+3Notion Developers+3](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Obsidian’s automation stack (choose when your workflows live in files):**\n\n* **Advanced URI** lets you create links that **open/create/edit notes, jump to headings, run commands**, and even append text-perfect for hooking mobile shortcuts, Raycast/Alfred, or other launchers into your vault.[ vinzent03.github.io+2GitHub+2](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Readwise bridges** push highlights into either tool. Obsidian has an **official Readwise plugin**; Notion has an **official Readwise sync** to a database. If your research starts in Kindle/Twitter/PDFs and ends in notes, these bridges keep the pipeline humming.[ GitHub+2docs.readwise.io+2](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**When to pick what:**\n\n* Use **Notion** if your automations are **database-driven** and you want triggers/actions on status changes plus low-code flows via Zapier.[ Notion+1](https://www.notion.com/help/database-automations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Use **Obsidian** if your automations are **file-driven** and you want to capture/transform text with **URIs, Templater, and QuickAdd** while keeping everything offline and version-controlled.[ vinzent03.github.io+2Silent Void 13+2](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Personal experience (why this section matters)**\n\nI tried mirroring my entire Notion workspace inside Obsidian and burned a week chasing parity. The breakthrough came by **splitting concerns**: my **project trackers** and team deliverables live in Notion with relations/rollups and a few automations; my **thinking system**\\-writing, research, and scratch-lives in Obsidian, powered by Dataview queries and a couple of QuickAdd macros. Readwise sends highlights to both: Obsidian for deep synthesis and Notion for resurfacing quotes in briefs. This division gave me fewer moving parts, faster load times, and zero fear of migrations later.[ docs.readwise.io+3Notion+3Blacksmith GUI+3](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**A powerful lens from a famous book**\n\nDavid Allen’s **Getting Things Done** reminds us that **you don’t manage time-you manage actions in context**. Tools should reduce friction from capture to “next actions” and keep projects visible at the right altitude. See *GTD*, **Chapter 6: Organizing-Setting Up the Right Buckets** (commonly paged around the mid-book section in most editions). Pair that lens with your stack: Notion automates actions via database changes and integrations; Obsidian keeps actions close to the text you’re thinking in, queryable across your vault.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# Is Notion AI or Obsidian better for a pure Zettelkasten?\n\nIf you want **strict, portable Zettelkasten** with durable IDs and links that survive any migration, Obsidian wins. Notes are plain .md files, wikilinks live in text, and you can layer plugins like Dataview later without changing your core structure. If you prefer **structured review cycles** with properties, filters, and dashboards, you can absolutely build an “atomic notes” database in Notion and use backlinks plus views to resurface ideas-great for teams or for solo users who think in tables. The choice hinges on whether you want your knowledge to behave like **files** or like **data**.\n\n# Can Notion replicate Obsidian’s graph view?\n\nNotion exposes backlinks and relational context, but it doesn’t ship a native node graph that mirrors Obsidian’s global or local graph. You can approximate graph-like discovery through linked databases, backlinks lists, and relation/rollup dashboards. If a **visual network map** is central to how you think and explore, Obsidian’s graph (plus filters and neighborhood views) is the better fit.\n\n# Can Obsidian replicate Notion’s databases?\n\nClose enough for many workflows. With **Dataview** you query frontmatter and inline fields to create tables/lists/calendars, and with **Database Folder** you get **editable table views** that write back to Markdown. It won’t be identical to Notion’s multi-view relational databases, but for project dashboards, writing pipelines, and reading trackers, the experience is surprisingly strong-while staying portable.\n\n# Which one is faster for capture on mobile?\n\nNotion’s widgets jump straight into a pinned page or database, which is great for a one-tap “Inbox.” Obsidian’s **Daily Notes** plus **QuickAdd** hotkeys feel instant once you’ve set them up, and they work without a network. If you’re often offline or hate spinners, Obsidian’s local-first speed is hard to beat; if you need a single tap into a shared team inbox, Notion’s widget-to-database flow is wonderfully simple.\n\n# How do AI features compare for real work?\n\nNotion AI is built-in: ask questions across your pages, summarize meetings, and draft content inside the editor. In Obsidian, AI is optional and modular-you wire it in via plugins or external scripts only where it helps. Choose Notion if you want **workspace-wide Q&amp;A** without tinkering; choose Obsidian if you want **local-first control** and selectively call AI on demand.\n\n# What about vendor lock-in and exports?\n\nObsidian starts portable-your vault is already Markdown. For Notion, adopt a **backup cadence** (workspace export to Markdown/CSV or HTML), document your database schemas, and you’ll be fine. If migration is on your 12–24 month horizon, keep your Notion pages relatively **markdown-friendly** (fewer nested block tricks, sensible headings) so exports need less cleanup.\n\n# Which tool is better for a team?\n\nIf you need **live collaboration**\\-multiple cursors in the same page, comments, permissions, and quick share-to-web-Notion feels natural. If your team is more **asynchronous** and comfortable with Git-like conventions or separate drafting → publishing stages, a shared Obsidian vault with clear “edit windows” and conflict rules is lean and reliable.\n\n# Can I keep both without duplicating effort?\n\nYes-use a **two-lane system**. Draft, research, and Zettelkasten in Obsidian; publish, coordinate, and automate in Notion. Bridge them with light-touch routines: send meeting outcomes from Notion into Obsidian as permanent notes, and elevate Obsidian insights back into Notion databases when they become action or shared knowledge. The trick is **not** mirroring everything-decide which artifacts live where and stick to it.\n\n# What’s the cleanest way to handle tasks across both?\n\nIn Obsidian, the **Tasks** plugin turns checkboxes into queryable tasks with due dates and recurrence, surfaced in your daily and weekly dashboards. In Notion, a **Tasks** database related to **Projects** keeps team accountability crisp. If you work in both, let tasks “live” in the tool that owns the outcome (team tasks in Notion; private execution tasks in Obsidian), and cross-link sparingly from the other side for context.\n\n# How do I set up IDs for Zettelkasten that survive everywhere?\n\nUse a **timestamp prefix** in filenames/titles like 20251020-1432 topic-name. It sorts chronologically, stays unique, and moves cleanly between systems. In Notion, add an **ID property** or prefix the page title; in Obsidian, the filename itself is the ID. When you later export, those IDs keep references stable and make bulk refactoring painless.\n\n# Can Notion work fully offline for days?\n\nIt can cache content and keep you productive for stretches, but database-heavy pages may behave differently until you reconnect. If you frequently go **multi-day offline** (travel, fieldwork, or spotty networks), Obsidian’s always-local vault is the safer default. For Notion-first users, create a “**Go Bag**” set of pages you open before going offline so they’re cached and ready.\n\n# How do I avoid a messy vault or workspace over time?\n\nCreate **guardrails** once and automate the rest. In Obsidian, enforce frontmatter keys (status, topic, source) and build Dataview dashboards that instantly shame stray notes into shape. In Notion, make database templates with required properties and block styles so every new page arrives structured. A five-minute daily **triage ritual** (rename, tag, link) prevents the slow drift into chaos.\n\n# What about security and privacy?\n\nObsidian’s content is local-first and can be end-to-end encrypted if you use its Sync service; you can also self-host backups and keep everything within your own security perimeter. Notion is cloud-first, with robust enterprise controls and admin features; review settings, access logs, and data retention policies that match your org’s compliance needs. The practical rule: pick the security model that matches where your **source of truth** lives-files you own vs. a shared workspace you administer.\n\n# What’s the fastest way to try both without wrecking my current setup?\n\nDo a **14-day test plan**:\n\n* Days 1–3: Recreate your daily note template in both apps.  \n* Days 4–7: Run your normal week; capture everything in **both** with minimal friction and no automations yet.  \n* Days 8–10: Add one dashboard (Notion: database views; Obsidian: Dataview + Tasks).  \n* Days 11–14: Export/import a tiny sample to test portability.  By the end, the ergonomics will tell you more than a features checklist.  \n\n# Personal experience (why this section matters)\n\nMy happiest hybrid setup came from ruthless boundaries: **thinking vault** in Obsidian, **shipping workspace** in Notion. I write atomic ideas with timestamp IDs in Obsidian, and once a week I promote 3–5 of them into Notion as proposals or briefs with clean properties and relations. The moment I stopped mirroring everything and started **promoting only the ready bits**, my system got lighter, my colleagues got clearer updates, and my exports stayed squeaky clean.\n\n# A powerful lens from a famous book\n\nFrom **Essentialism** by Greg McKeown-see the early chapters on **trade-offs and the disciplined pursuit of less** (often grouped near the first third of the book). The core prompt is simple: “What is the **one thing** that will matter most?” Apply it to tool choice. If your priority is **portability and flow** while thinking, Obsidian wins. If your priority is **shared visibility and automated coordination**, Notion wins. You can run both-but only if you choose **what belongs where** and say no to everything else.\n\n",

I did use GEMINI.md\n\nI was reaching GEMINI Pro's limits in couple of hours which was stopping me from progressing. So I did the following\n\n\nWent on Google cloud and setup a project, and added a billing account.  Then setup an api key on gemini ai studio and linked with project (without this the api key was not working) I used the api for 2 days and from yesterday afternoon all i can see is i hit the limit , and i checked the billing in Google cloud and it was around 15 $\nI used the above mentioned api key with Roocode it is great,  a lot better than Gemini code console.\n\nSince this stopped working , I loaded open router with 10$, so that I can start using models.\n\nI am currently using meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free on cline, I feel roocode is better but I was experimenting anyway.\n\nI want to use Claude code but , I dont have deep pockets. It's expensive for me where I live in because of $ conversion. So I am currently using free models but I want to go to paid models once I get my project on track and when someone can pay for my products or when I can afford them (hopefully soon).\n\nmy ask: \n- What refinements can I do for my above process.\n- Which free models are good for coding, and there are ton of models in roocode , I dont even understand them. I want to have a liberal understanding of what a model can do (for example mistral, 10b, 70b, fast all these words doesn’t make sense to me , so I want to read a bit to understand) , suggest me sources where I can read.\n- how to keep my self updated on this stuff, Where I live is not ideal environment and no one discusses the AI things, so I am not updated.\n\n- Is there a way I can use some models (such as Gemini pro 2.5 ) and get away without paying bill (I know i cant pay bill for google cloud when I am setting it up, I know its not good but that’s the only way I can learn)\n\n- Best free way and paid way to explain UI / provide mockup designs to the LLM via roocode or something similar, what I understood in last week that its harder to explain in prompt where my textbox should be and how it is now and make the LLM understand\n\n- i want to feed UI designs to LLM which it can use it for button sizes and colors and positions for UI, which tools to use (figma didn’t work for me, if you are using it give me a source to study up please ), suggest me tools and resources which i can use and lookup.\n- I discovered mermaid yesterday, it makes sense to use it, \n\nare there any better things I can use, any improvements such as prompts process, anything , suggest and guide please.\n\nAlso i don’t know if Github copilot is as good as any of above options because in my past experience it’s not great.\n\nPlease excuse typos, English is my second language.\n",
