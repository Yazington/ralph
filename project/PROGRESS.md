# Progress

- Recorded the tech stack (Vite, React, Tailwind, shadcn, Vitetest, PlaywrightMCP, TavilyMCP) from `project/TECH_STACK.md`.
- Noted the TODO app scope (add/edit/complete/delete tasks with All/Active/Completed filters stored client-side) from `project/specs/0003-app-scope.md`.
- Defined typed task operations and Vitest suites that cover add/edit/complete/delete flows to match the spec-driven requirements.
- Captured the empty-state guidance (no tasks, all clear, filter empty) so domain helpers can drive the calm UI messaging.
- Logged the feedback states spec (empty-title input errors, optimistic saving, undoable deletions) to guide new domain helpers.
- Absorbed the 0008 UX flow spec so helpers can enforce first-run focus/hints, add-edit keyboard behaviors, and dim/sort completed tasks beneath active ones.
- Cataloged the available specs (0001 typography through 0011 feedback states) so the next tasks can target uncovered requirements like accessibility.
- Captured the 0010 accessibility spec: every action must be keyboard reachable, focus rings stay visible, controls keep 40px hit targets, and colors cannot be sole state indicators.
- Built accessibility domain helpers that audit keyboard reachability, persistent focus rings, 40px hit targets, and color-plus indicators so spec 0010 can stay enforceable in tests.
- Introduced feedback-state helpers that gate empty submissions with subtle helper text, apply optimistic non-blocking saves, and remove tasks with a 5s undo toast per spec 0011.
- Captured the 0007 interactions spec: Enter submits new tasks, Escape backs out of edits, checkbox clicks toggle completion, focus rings must use the accent cyan, and motion stays within 140-200ms easing while honoring reduced-motion.
- Learned the 0006 components spec: composer pairs a text field with an Add button, todo rows bundle checkbox+title+inline edit, icon-only edit/delete buttons flank each item, and the footer shows the live count plus filter pills.
- Sketched component blueprints so specs can stay enforceable: composer blueprint ties Enter submission to the Add button, todo rows flag inline-editable titles plus completion checkboxes, action clusters expose icon-only edit/delete buttons, and the footer blueprint keeps the live count with all three filter pills.
- Confirmed the workspace currently lacks a package.json, so pnpm/vitest can't execute until a manifest exists; leaving the test suite pending this setup.
- Hit the token read limit when trying to open `project/specs/0005-spacing-shape.md`, so future passes need targeted excerpts instead of whole-file reads.
- Captured the 0005 spacing+shape spec detailing the 4-32px spacing scale, 16px panels, 10px control radii, and semi-transparent 1px borders.
- Logged the 0004 layout spec calling for a centered, padded panel over a full-viewport background with header/input/list/footer sections and mobile-friendly 16px gutters.
- Implemented layout domain helpers that return viewport-filling surface data, a centered generous panel that flips to full-width with 16px gutters at ≤640px, and an ordered header/input/list/footer stack plus responsive metadata so spec 0004 can stay testable.
- Logged the typography spec (0001): IBM Plex Mono is the primary face, JetBrains Mono acts as fallback, and only weights 400/500/600 should load to keep the UI calm.
- Added typography domain helpers plus Vitest coverage that emit a quoted font stack, guard supported weights, and plan swap-loaded font requests so the spec remains enforceable during implementation.
- Captured the 0002 color palette spec: base #090B0D surface, layered panels (#0B1013, #101D1E, #132E2C), translucent #2B2C2D dividers, mint #B5D7CD primary copy, muted #6A8F96 text, muted-alt #588391, and accent cyan #7299A2 for focus/links.
- Hit the command token cap when listing `project/domain_types`, so future passes need narrower glob patterns or direct file reads instead of dumping the whole directory.
