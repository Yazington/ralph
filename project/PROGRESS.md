# Progress

- Recorded the tech stack (Vite, React, Tailwind, shadcn, Vitetest, PlaywrightMCP, TavilyMCP) from `project/TECH_STACK.md`.
- Noted the TODO app scope (add/edit/complete/delete tasks with All/Active/Completed filters stored client-side) from `project/specs/0003-app-scope.md`.
- Defined typed task operations and Vitest suites that cover add/edit/complete/delete flows to match the spec-driven requirements.
- Captured the empty-state guidance (no tasks, all clear, filter empty) so domain helpers can drive the calm UI messaging.
- Logged the feedback states spec (empty-title input errors, optimistic saving, undoable deletions) to guide new domain helpers.
- Absorbed the 0008 UX flow spec so helpers can enforce first-run focus/hints, add-edit keyboard behaviors, and dim/sort completed tasks beneath active ones.
