# Requirements

- Build a single-page TODO experience with local-only persistence, enabling users to add, edit, complete, and remove tasks.
- Provide filters for All, Active, and Completed tasks so users can focus on the right subset.
- Tasks should carry enough metadata to be sortable, editable, and filterable without relying on global mutable state.
